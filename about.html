       <h2>About Us</h2>          
       <p>Bubble Under is a group of diving enthusiasts based in          
           the south-west UK who meet up for diving trips in the          
           summer months when the weather is good and the bacon          
           rolls are flowing. We arrange weekends away as small          
           groups to cut the costs of accommodation and travel and          
           to ensure that everyone gets a trustworthy dive          
           buddy.</p>          
       <p>Although we’re based in the south-west, we don’t stay on          
           our own turf: past diving weekends away have included          
           trips up to Scapa Flow in Scotland and to Malta’s          
           numerous wreck sites.</p>          
       <p>When we’re not diving, we often meet up in a local pub          
           to talk about our recent adventures (any excuse,          
           eh?).</p>
